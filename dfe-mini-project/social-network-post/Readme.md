Goal of this mini-project is to learn how eventListeners and function are working together to make change on DOM. 

Instructions: 

1. When user clicks on `<button>` change `.like-label` to show 1, and when click again toggle back to original state. 
2. When user submits the form, add a new `<div class="comment">` inside `<div class="comments">`. Use the existing `.comment` for reference

Bonus: change the svg fill color on "liked" state.
