# JS Practice

Practices and mini-projects I created for my introduction to front-end course. Practices are bunch of short questions testing your knowledge on certain topic. Mini-projects are testing your coding skills and putting your knowledge into a more practical example.

So far the topics are DOM, events, functions, arrays and objects.

Unfortunately since I'm presenting these on my course, there is not much documentation, but I plan to add more soon.
