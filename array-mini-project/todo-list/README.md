Completed example: https://todo.altunleyda.now.sh/

Goal of this mini-project is to practice using eventListeners and functions with arrays to change DOM using a data structure which represents UI.

Instructions: 

1. Create a data array containing todo objects which have two properties: text, which will be a string and isDone which is a boolean. Fill it with some data.
2. Using `forEach` show a `.todo` div for each object in your data array on page.
3. When user clicks on a `.todo` toggle the `isDone` property representing that `.todo` and update DOM
4. When user submits the form, add a new todo to your data array and update the DOM
